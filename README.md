**Requirements:**

Custom Objects - Transaction, Transaction Items

Make Rest API requests when Transaction Items created

**Request #1**

Total number of Transaction Items for that Transaction = Transaction count

Send Transaction Items information in JSON format

**Request #2**

If Request #1 returns Success

Send Transaction information in JSON format



**Solution**
1. Collect all Transaction Ids in a Single Apex Transactions using Apex Triggers
2. Query DB for Transaction along with Transaction Items in an inner query 
3. Compare Transaction Items related list size with Transaction Recordâ€™s field (Transaction_count)
4. If they are equal then generate both json payloads and go to step 6
5. Else continue with next transaction
6. If both payloads are not null make Transaction Item API call and go to step 8
7. Else continue with next transaction
8. Check response of Transaction Item API call, if success then call Transaction API call
